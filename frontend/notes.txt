# applciation notes
- Cannot scroll in the 'My reservations List'
- When making a reservation, cannot change the date or time
- No mesage indicating that the reservatino was successful
- Should include a manager role (Edit restaurants, accept or cancel pending reservations)
- Datetime picker not supported in web
- When I try to load the app from the mobile, it never loads. Should be something with the network (on other laptop connected to other networks it works)


- â€º Opening on Android...
CommandError: Required property 'android.package' is not found in the project app.json. This is required to open the app.


- Uncaught Eroor: java.io.IOException.Failed to download remote update
